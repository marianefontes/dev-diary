# 📘 My Personal Dev Diary 

This is a personal repository where I document notes, code snippets, and study summaries based on the technologies I've been working with since last year. The focus is on modern web development, covering both frontend and backend stacks.

## ✍️ Background

I started writing these study notes on Notion to organize my learning process and solidify key concepts during my journey as a developer.

Now, I'm gradually reviewing and migrating that content to GitHub, where I can version it properly, keep things structured, and share my progress more openly.

## 🚀 What's Next

As I continue to deepen my knowledge, I’ll be expanding this repository with new content and more detailed explanations — gradually building a solid, well-documented reference for the technologies I work with.
